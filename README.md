# Snake Game in Python

This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game, built using Python and the Tkinter library. Enjoy hours of fun as you guide your snake to collect food, grow longer, and achieve the highest score while avoiding collisions!

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The snake moves continuously in the direction of your choice, and its speed can be adjusted.
- **Food Generation:** Randomly placed food appears on the canvas for the snake to eat and grow.
- **Score Tracking:** The score increases as the snake eats food and grows longer.
- **Game Over Conditions:** The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Simple Controls:** Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
